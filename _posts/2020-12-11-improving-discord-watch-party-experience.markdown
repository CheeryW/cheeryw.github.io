This past year has been a special year. With the few-month-long quarantine still going on, some of the more conventional means of sociolizing has been greatly challenged. As for me, a college student, I can't check out school events by just walking around the campus anymore. I can't hangout and discuss with my classmates at the library anymore. Many things have changed because of the online learning environment. To have a fulfiling last few months of my undergraduate studies, I tried my best to engage with my other classmates online. During this process, I became a regular Discord user. In this class design project, my teammates (Yong Woon Chung and Dennis Juanito) and I all have high motivation to re-design Discord because it is truly something that helps connecting people during this pandemic, and we believe that we have the potential to make the socializing experience on Discord better.

## Find the Problem
To find out what exactly we can improve on Discord, we first did some user research. We came up with some questions to ask users and then we translated the them to a survey using Google Forms. We mass distributed the survey through other Discord Channels, Reddit, close friends, and other social medias. 

### User Demographics
Our survey got 41 responses in total. These participants of the survey __mostly have used Discord on regular basis and all of them have used Discord for social activities__. 75.6% of our survey respondents are 18 to 25 years old, and 22% of them are 26 to 35 years old. It is safe to say that in this study, we are mostly targeting users who are __18 to 35 years old__.

### Research Findings
Below are our findings:

* 87.8% of the respondents have done a video call/screen share on Discord before
* 41.5% of the respondents have used Discord to watch Netflix/YouTube/Twitch, etc. before
* 61% of the respondents wish the UI on Discord is more customizable
* Screen sharing is the second most unsatisfying feature of Discord, right after notification settings
* Other commonly used apps that are similar to Discord are Zoom, Facebook Messenger, and Slack

After reviewing those findings, we decided that we want to focus on improving the experience of a Discord watch party for movies or TV shows, since screen sharing is a commonly used feature in Discord that people have complaints about, and a watch party is a particular usage of this slightly unsatisfying feature that we can work on.

Below is my style references.

You lived before you met me?! Ow, my spirit! Humans dating robots is sick. __You people wonder why I'm still single?__ *It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!* I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.

### Why not indeed!

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. 

* Shinier than yours, meatbag.
* This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
* Ooh, name it after me!

Say what? Throw her in the brig.
