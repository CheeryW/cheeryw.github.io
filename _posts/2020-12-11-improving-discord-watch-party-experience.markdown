This past year has been a special year. With the few-month-long quarantine still going on, some of the more conventional means of sociolizing has been greatly challenged. As for me, a college student, I can't check out school events by just walking around the campus anymore. I can't hangout and discuss with my classmates at the library anymore. Many things have changed because of the online learning environment. To have a fulfiling last few months of my undergraduate studies, I tried my best to engage with my other classmates online. During this process, I became a regular Discord user. In this class design project, my teammates (Yong Woon Chung and Dennis Juanito) and I all have high motivation to re-design Discord because it is truly something that helps connecting people during this pandemic, and we believe that we have the potential to make the socializing experience on Discord better.

## Find the Problem
To find out what exactly we can improve on Discord, we first did some user research.


Below is my style references.

You lived before you met me?! Ow, my spirit! Humans dating robots is sick. __You people wonder why I'm still single?__ *It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!* I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.

## Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.

Oh, I don't have time for this. 

1. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
2. Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
3. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

### Why not indeed!

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. 

* Shinier than yours, meatbag.
* This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
* Ooh, name it after me!

Say what? Throw her in the brig.
