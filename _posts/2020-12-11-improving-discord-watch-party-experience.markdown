This past year has been a special year. With the few-month-long quarantine still going on, some of the more conventional means of sociolizing has been greatly challenged. As for me, a college student, I can't check out school events by just walking around the campus anymore. I can't hangout and discuss with my classmates at the library anymore. Many things have changed because of the online learning environment. To have a fulfiling last few months of my undergraduate studies, I tried my best to engage with my other classmates online. During this process, I became a regular Discord user. In this class design project, my teammates (Yong Woon Chung and Dennis Juanito) and I all have high motivation to re-design Discord because it is truly something that helps connecting people during this pandemic, and we believe that we have the potential to make the socializing experience on Discord better.

## Find the Problem
To find out what exactly we can improve on Discord, we first did some user research. We came up with some questions to ask users and then we translated the them to a survey using Google Forms. We mass distributed the survey through other Discord Channels, Reddit, close friends, and other social medias. 

### User Demographics
Our survey got 41 responses in total. These participants of the survey __mostly have used Discord on regular basis and all of them have used Discord for social activities__. 75.6% of our survey respondents are 18 to 25 years old, and 22% of them are 26 to 35 years old. It is safe to say that in this study, we are mostly targeting users who are __18 to 35 years old__.

### Research Findings
Below are our findings:

* 87.8% of the respondents have done a video call/screen share on Discord before
* 41.5% of the respondents have used Discord to watch Netflix/YouTube/Twitch, etc. before
* 61% of the respondents wish the UI on Discord is more customizable
* Screen sharing is the second most unsatisfying feature of Discord, right after notification settings
* Other commonly used apps that are similar to Discord are Zoom, Facebook Messenger, and Slack

After reviewing those findings, we decided that we want to focus on improving the experience of a Discord watch party for movies or TV shows, since screen sharing is a commonly used feature in Discord that people have complaints about, and a watch party is a particular usage of this slightly unsatisfying feature that we can work on.

## User Personas
Now that we finished user research, we wanted to visualize a few user personas to have a deeper understanding of our target audience, so we drafted the following personas:

## Competitors
Below we listed some other apps that can also be used to hold a watch party. We analyzed their pros and cons, so that we can possibly integrate some good features into our design and avoid things they don't do so great on.

### Netflix Party
URL: https://www.netflixparty.com
#### Pros
* The user doesn't have to share their screen in order to watch them together with their friends. The user only needs to share a link to a Netflix video with their friends so that they can start to watch it together.
* Has interactive live comments that visible to all users.
* Users have a variety of options that they can stream together with their friends, such as Netflix, Disney, Hulu, and HBO.
* No copyright issues.

#### Cons
* All users are currently required to have a Netflix account before allowing the user the service.
* Can’t stream youtube videos.
* Complicated installation process (learning curve for less tech-advanced people)
* Chat only, no video camera interaction
* Chat isn’t very interactive/customizable (Discord has custom server emotes and features/functions that can make it feel more personalized to each user group)

### Zoom
#### Pros
* Video quality and screen sharing features are excellent.
* Have more capacity for people to be on social meetings.

#### Cons
* The UI-designed feels towards for non-social meetings.
* Copyright issues
* Control over UI disappears when sharing screen
* No volume slider for each person
* No volume slider for screen being shared

### Air Time
#### Pros
#### Cons

### Rave
#### Pros
#### Cons

Below is my style references.

You lived before you met me?! Ow, my spirit! Humans dating robots is sick. __You people wonder why I'm still single?__ *It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!* I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.
### Why not indeed!

Say what? Throw her in the brig.
